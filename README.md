<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<h3>Before Beginning the Lab</h3>

<p>
Before we commence the lab, make sure to login in via the admin panel. Once logged in, go ahead and navigate to the departments section. From here, make sure to delete the maintenance department as we will no longer be needed this department. Also make sure that the system administration department is a 'TOP Level Department' in the configuration settings.
</p>

  
<h3>Intake</h3>
<p>
For this intake portion, we will begin by creating a ticket via our osticket 'end user' link. By doing so, once on the website we are going to click on 'open a new ticket'. We are going to be using the 'users' we created in the previous labs. To sign in and create a ticket.

From here, you will begin to fill in the end user information we created from the previous lab. We will also include a helpdesk topic, 'Report a problem'. While our issue is going to be a critical issue; we are simply creating user error which can be common within a helpdesk role. Our issue at has is going to be: 'entire mobile/online banking system is down'. Then we will include a brief description that can help the helpdesk agent; afterwards we will make sure to click on 'create ticket' at the bottom of the page.

Now, we will be going back to the admin portal (make sure you are logged out of the admin credentials). Once you are at the admin portal, we are going to log in as the support team user we created in our previous portion of the lab. Once you are logged in, you should be seeing the new ticket we have made.

<h3>Assignment and Communication</h3>

<p>
In this section, we will examine the tickets properties. Make sure to go over, the priority, department, SLA, and who the ticket is assigned to. Make changes as necessary.
